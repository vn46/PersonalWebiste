# Personal Website
This is a website all about me, a CS student at Cornell University. Welcome to my website and thank you for your interests in my work!
# About the project
My personal website is in fact the first website that I have ever created. It is mobile responsive and some of the contents are also desgined by me. I decided to start the project mainly because I wanted to pick up new programming languages over the summer and I also think that having a website to showcase my future work would be very awesome.
